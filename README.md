# Data Analysis and Prediction Project

## Overview
This project involves the analysis and prediction of anonymized data. The dataset was provided with the objective of performing data analysis, creating predictive models, and developing a user interface for data visualization using Streamlit.

## Project Description
The project includes the following main components:

1. **Data Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the patterns and relationships within the dataset. Various statistical and visualization techniques were applied to gain insights into the data.

2. **Predictive Modeling:** Predictive models were developed to forecast certain outcomes based on the available features in the dataset. Machine learning algorithms such as classification or regression were employed depending on the nature of the prediction task.

3. **Streamlit Application:** A user interface was built using Streamlit to visualize the analyzed data and predictions. The Streamlit app provides an interactive platform for users to explore the insights derived from the data and interact with the predictive models.

## Usage
To run the Streamlit application:

1. Run `main.py` to create all the dbs and a model.
2. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run welcome.py`.
3. Access the application through the provided URL in the terminal.

## Dataset Information
Due to the nature of the dataset, it has been anonymized to maintain confidentiality. As a result, detailed information about the dataset cannot be disclosed.

## Important notion
This is project in progress, I haven't finished it yet.
